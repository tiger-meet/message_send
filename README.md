## Details

TigerMeet is a responsive web application that will enable Princeton University students to connect with other students for recreation, transportation, and academic coordination. It is intended to be subdivided into sections of general interest (i.e. Sports, Transportation), with the ability to create specific events. Within sections and events, we plan on having chat capabilities for users to connect.
